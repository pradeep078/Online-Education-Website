<h1>This set of Data Structure Interview Questions & Answers focuses on "Singly Linked List Operations -"</h1>
<div style="color: blue">

a) Linked list<br>
b) Node list<br>
c) Primitive list<br>
d) None of the mentioned<br>

<p style="color: black">Answer: a</p>
<p style="color: red">Explanation: None.</p>
2. Consider an implementation of unsorted singly linked list. Suppose it has its representation with a head pointer only.
Given the representation, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?<br>
i)	Insertion at the front of the linked list<br>
ii)	Insertion at the end of the linked list<br>
iii) Deletion of the front node of the linked list<br>
iv)	Deletion of the last node of the linked list<br>
a) I and II<br>

{<br>
   &nbsp &nbsp int data;<br>
   &nbsp &nbsp struct node * next;<br>
}<br>
&nbsp typedef struct node NODE;<br>
&nbsp NODE *ptr;<br>
Which of the following c code is used to create new node?<br>
